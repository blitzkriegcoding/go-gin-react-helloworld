# go-gin-react-helloworld
Hello World web app created with Golang + Gin & React + Bootstrap

#### What?
This is a basic "Hello World" web application that demonstrates a basic example of a web application using Golang + Gin & React + Bootstrap. Golang acts as the server and Gin is used to create the routes needed to serve the web page. React is used as the front-end technology, via a .jsx file, and is styled using Bootstrap via inline html within the index.html file. Working together they create a basic "Hello World" template for making web pages with React and hosting them with Golang.

#### How to use

` go run main.go `

* if the port is already in use, change the port number in the main.go file
